			\item Administrators will be able to determine and limit certain features and functionalities that all users are exposed to throughout the system.
			\item Teachers, with the roles or "powers" assigned to them by the administrator will be able to limit the amount of content students(enrolled or not) are exposed to.
			\item The administrator will be able to customise the look and feel of the website, along with the method and style of authentication.
			\item The decision to make a course or activity available to all users is at the Administrator and/or teachers discretion. 
		\end{itemize} 
		  
		\subsection{Entry Pages}
