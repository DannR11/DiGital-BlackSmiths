This is an already implemented LMS that offers a number of features, among which some, will be useful for the implementation of our system&rsquo;s requirements. The system will therefore be built around it, and every component developed by the development team would need to interface with this already existing system. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c7">Moodle is coded using PHP</span><span class="c24 c7">[17]</span><span class="c1">, thus any interfacing by any developed subsystems would have to consider this. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.956267486aac972108b9d72e8e424cfa43ade16a"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c27"><tbody><tr class="c9"><td class="c31" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 610.00px; height: 440.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 610.00px; height: 440.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p></td></tr><tr class="c9"><td class="c31" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Block Diagram 1 System Interfaces</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c2"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c11 c10"><span class="c6">2.1.2 User Interfaces</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">All users will interact with a web interface in the form of a website. This will require users to be logged in using a username and password combination, if not, options will be available for them to register or log in using a guest account. The user interface subsystem developed by the development team will work in tandem and enhance the interface already implemented by the Moodle LMS.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c7">Users will have access to this interface using modern web browsers on either mobile or desktop platforms. It will allow them to access quizzes which will have questions answerable through various means of interaction, including typing in the answers or selecting options made available. The interface will also allow users to view academic videos and view academic documents or slides.

The LMS website should never come close to this however, as accessing memory up to those limits (e.g. 4GB) from cache may not be possible for most devices and would result in a large amount of thrashing and very slow and nearly unresponsive sites.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">Include here: estimations of the average size of a webpage in for both desktop and mobile browsers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">This information would only be accurate after an actual product has been done, either the first, second or other iteration.

Quizzes will also be available to for the students to complete.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">The system will reward students will experience points after they complete quizzes, read academic slides and presentations, and watch content videos. After the completion of some quizzes, students may be awarded with badges for their performance. Students&rsquo; performances levels in their various subjects will be used to place them in leaderboards, if they so wish.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">The system will also have a chatbot to make use of the website an easier experience for the users themselves. The chatbot will enable students to ask for hints for questions if available, to introduce the interface, to enable users to send feedback, and to act as a general guide to the website and how it works. Furthermore, it will aid in user interaction throughout the LMS website through conversational interaction.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c11 c17"><span class="c6">2.3 User Characteristics</span></p><p class="c2 c17"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c14 c7">Describe the general characteristics of the intended users including educational level, experience, expertise, and technical skills.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">Four different types of users interact with the system, and these are: students, the administrator, expert consultants (teachers) and guest users. The system satisfies different requirements for each of these users. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">The students can use the &ldquo;Thutong LMS&rdquo; to view and read academic documents in the form of slides and presentations for whichever course they choose, do quizzes and be graded on those quizzes. They can also participate in subject based leaderboards which rank their performance levels with other students registered in the system. Students can also watch academic videos pertaining to the academic courses provided. Students can also ask questions and post other kinds of comment in the discussion boards available.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">The administrator can add and remove academic courses, including anything that composes them (quizzes, academic slides and notes, videos). In addition to this, they can view academic content but will not experience any functionality offered for gamification purposes as well as chatbot functionality. Sponsor advertisements and logos presented on the login pages as well as on the about page can be added and removed by the administrator. Administrators can also comment on available discussion boards.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">The expert consultants, can add academic content in already existing courses i.e. academic notes or presentations, academic videos as well as making new quizzes. They can also view already existing academic content, a function that can be useful for edifying classroom teaching. They, like the administrator will not experience functionality offered for gamification purpose but can use some chatbot functionality. Since they won&rsquo;t be allowed to complete quizzes, they cannot ask the chatbot for hints but like students they can use it as a general conversational guide to the website, and for user feedback as well. Expert consultants will also be able to comment on available discussion boards.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">The guest users will be for the most part treated as expert consultants in so far as gamification and chatbot functionality is concerned. They will also be able to view academic content but will not be allowed to complete academic quizzes. In addition to this, they will not be allowed to comment in the available discussion boards. </span></p><p class="c2 c17"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c11 c17"><span class="c6">2.4 Constraints</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c14 c7">Describe the restrictions on the solutions space or options of the developer.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c14 c7"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">The usage of the Moodle LMS as a base for the development of the &ldquo;Thutong LMS&rdquo; presents a number of limitations. Moodle is coded in PHP, and as such any additional features that the development team would develop would either need to interface in some way with the PHP coded Moodle system, or use PHP for seamless integration.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c11 c17"><span class="c6">2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c14 c7">List the factors that affect the requirements</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">Content made available in the &ldquo;Thutong LMS&rdquo; is of the South African CAPS curriculum.
